Hello, I'm Bachdx. I'm a developer, currently playing with [Ruby(rails)](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/index.html) (I love this)

I like being alone, yes, ALONE. Makes me comfortable.

I love making stuffs for web, learning new technologies, tabacco & redbull (the best combo for me)

I made this site for sharing my knowledges (if something's wrong or incomplete please point me out. Thanks)
And, of courses for my personal blogs.

Hope this site will help you some way, some how. I dont know..
