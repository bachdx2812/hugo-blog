# This is my first ever post on my blog
So I've been working on some of my pet projects for the last few days in my 3-holiday(三連休)
which is deployed at [ImageFun](https://bachdx2812.github.io/image-fun-prod/)
with VueJS

Here come some screenshots

## HomePage
![](/images/image-fun1.jpg)
## Image `filter`
![](/images/image-fun2.jpg)

### The idea
I have absolutely no idea about what I tried to build (lol) . Just fell so boring and wanna do
some interesting stuff so I do this for fun actually.

But still...

Things I want to do after build some first initalization.

#### Currently

- List up beautiful images from nowhere
- Click to see full image and can `filter` like instagram
- ...Over

Shit...This is just so SHIT dude!
I know right ?

But still Im working on it when I have free time (which I have tons of)


#### List up things I will do (or at least try to do)

- Filter Image by category (fetch images from nowhere within the category name which you input)
- Allow you to upload image, filter, and download them filtered
- Social share ? Nah, ...
- ...and more to come
